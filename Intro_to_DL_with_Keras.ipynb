    "\n",
    "Now you see we used five types of layers from Keras, namely `Conv2D`, `MaxPool2D`, `Dense`, `Flatten` and `Dropout`. Let's briefly look at what they do, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conv2D and Maxpool2D\n",
    "\n",
    "These two are a pair. Convolution (`Conv2D`) in general means we take the 5x5x3 filter and slide it over the complete image and along the way take the dot product between the filter and chunks of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Image and Sliding Window\n",
    "<img src= 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FUEkm0JghT3ab8P7p9c5Qg.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution\n",
    "<img src= 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3sfzVenrdS5MWGsmSCbx3A.png' />\n",
    "<img src = 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mcBbGiV8ne9NhF3SlpjAsA.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder how do we convert a section of image (via sliding window) to a certain number - that is the magic of pooling. The most popular pooling technique is Maxpooling (`Maxpool2D`).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Max-) Pooling\n",
    "<img src = 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jU_Mp73fXzh9_ffvtnbrDQ.png' />\n",

    "If you wish to know more regarding Convolution and Pooling, [this article](https://adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Part-2/) or [this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/pooling-layers-for-convolutional-neural-networks/) can be good starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another point worthing noting here is the activation function. Activation function decides, whether a neuron should be __activated__ (output a `True` or `1` value) or not (output a `False` or `0` value) by calculating weighted sum and further adding bias with it. The purpose of the activation function is to introduce __non-linearity__ into the output of a neuron. In this tutorial we used the __Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)__ activation function in the `conv2D` layers - given any value $x$, if $x > 0$ then output $x$; otherwise output $0$.\n",

    "<img src = 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DfMRHwxY1gyyDmrIAd-gjQ.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a `softmax` activation to get the final output of the NN. Generally, we use __softmax__ activation instead of __sigmoid__ with the cross-entropy loss because softmax activation distributes the probability throughout each output node. If the problem is a binary classification, using sigmoid is same as softmax. For multi-class classification use sofmax with cross-entropy.\n",

    "More discussions regarding ReLU and other activation function can be found [here](https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flatten and Dense\n",
    "\n",
    "After maxpooling, we have pooled feature maps from images. The flatten layer, as the name suggests, flatten our pooled feature map into a column like in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/73_blog_image_1.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "A dense layer represents a matrix vector multiplication. (assuming your batch size is 1) The values in the matrix are the trainable parameters which get updated during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you get a m dimensional vector as output. A dense layer thus is used to change the dimensions of your vector. Mathematically speaking, it applies a rotation, scaling, translation transform to your vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "A dropout layer is used for regularization where you randomly set some of the dimensions of your input vector to be zero with probability `𝑘𝑒𝑒𝑝_𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏`. A dropout layer does not have any trainable parameters (i.e. nothing gets updated during backward pass of backpropagation). To ensure that expected sum of vectors fed to this layer remains the same if no dropout was applied, the remaining dimensions which are not set to zero are scaled by $\\frac{1}{𝑘𝑒𝑒𝑝\\_𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT\n",
    "Remember in the beginning we said that Keras is a high-level API that builds on the backend like TF? You must wonder why we need such an API - the answer is Keras makes our life easier. For instance, a similar (and much __simpler__) NN would be written in TF like below:\n",
